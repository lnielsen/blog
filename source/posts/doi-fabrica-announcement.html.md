### Metadata Store frontend  deprecation

With DOI Fabrica we start giving a farewell to the Metadata Store frontend (MDS), however, this would not happen overnight. The MDS frontend will be available to DataCite clients til March 2018. Both applications will run in parellel during this time. Nevertheless, we strongly suggest our clients to start getting onboard DOI Fabrica to find, create, manage, connect and track DOIs for your organization.
